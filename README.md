# CSCI-GA.2560 Artificial Intelligence
This repository contains four lab assignments from CSCI-GA.2560 Artificial Intelligence course at NYU in Fall 2021. Each folder contains code that can run independently, and README file in each folder has information about how to run the code. The contents of each folder are as follows:

## Lab 1
The purpose of this lab is to implement three search algorithms
* Breadth First Search 
* Iterative Deepening Search
* A* Search

## Lab 2
This lab has three modes as below:
* BNF to CNF converter
* Generic DPLL solver
* take BNF as an input and solve it by running above two modes

## Lab 3
This lab is to implement
* Markov Process Solver

## Lab 4
The purpose this lab is to implement two algorithms
* KNN
* KMeans

### Dependencies
* C++
* Python3
